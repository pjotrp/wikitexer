== Introduction ==

What would I give to have simple wiki markup mixed with LaTeX for
writing documents? That itch is being scratched here.

MediaWiki is becoming something of a standard, so that markup makes
sense to support. Other markups may be supported by input handlers in
the future. We create output handlers for LaTeX and HTML. This means,
to support both outputs, rather then converting native LaTeX or HTML
to the other format we create special generators (macro's) that can
provide either. This avoids the complexity of translation routines at the
expense of creating generators through a shared mechanism.


== MediaWiki input handler ==

The mediawiki input handler will support a subset of MediaWiki style 
markup. Markup (like LaTex) it will basically ignore. So it should
support headers, emphasing text and URLs initially.


== LaTeX output handler ==

Markup is translated to native LaTex.


== HTML output handler ==

Markup is translated to HTML. Embedded LaTeX is ignored. This is
important. If HTML output is critical use macro's rather then LaTeX
commands and register these with the HTML handler.


== Macro's ==

LaTeX is a macro language, but not always that nice to program.
Embedding Ruby and Ruby macro's is a great feature to add to LaTeX
native macros.
